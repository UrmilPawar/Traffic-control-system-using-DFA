# Traffic-control-system-using-DFA
This project is an attempt to create a traffic control system with the help of deterministic finite automata which will adaptively handle the traffic by considering in which direction cars are present currently.

The project is implemented in Python:
The following are the points which are taken into consideration while developing the project:
1. Checking the validity of input data to ensure accurate processing. 
2. Maintaining a safe state if there is any problem with the sensors.
2. Consideration of Emergency vehicles like Ambulance, Firebrigade and Police cars.
3. Preventing Unnecessary delays and avoiding wastage of time on empty roads.
4. Avoid biasing towards a single direction to ensure a more balanced flow during heavy traffic.
5. Easy  integration into real-world scenarios.
